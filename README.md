Subject: Node.js JavaScript Programming Concepts

Project Description

This repository contains four separate JavaScript files demonstrating fundamental JavaScript concepts:
1. Variable Hoisting (hoisting.js)
2. Function Hoisting (task.js)
3. Context Binding - 'this' keyword (task3.js)
4. Higher Order Functions (task4.js)

Requirements

- Node.js (version 12.0.0 or higher)
- No external dependencies required (uses built-in JavaScript features)

File Structure

├── hoisting.js        # Task 1: Variable hoisting with var, let, const
├── task.js            # Task 2: Function hoisting demonstrations

How to Run Each Task

Task 1 - Variable Hoisting:
   node hoisting.js

Task 2 - Function Hoisting:
   node task.js

Task 3 - Context Binding:
   node task3.js

Task 4 - Higher Order Functions:
   node task4.js

Run All Tasks (Optional):
You can run all tasks one by one to see complete output:
   node hoisting.js && node task.js && node task3.js && node task4.js

Task Details

Task 1 (hoisting.js) - Variable Hoisting
- Demonstrates how 'var' variables are hoisted with undefined value
- Shows 'let' and 'const' variables in Temporal Dead Zone
- Includes error handling with try-catch blocks
- Expected Output: Shows undefined vs ReferenceError behaviors

Task 2 (task.js) - Function Hoisting
- Function declarations vs function expressions hoisting behavior
- Calling functions before and after their definitions
- Error handling for unavailable functions
- Expected Output: Successful calls vs error messages

Task 3 (task3.js) - Context Binding
- 'this' keyword behavior in regular vs arrow functions
- Object method calls vs detached function calls
- Different contexts and their effects
- Expected Output: Object references and global context comparisons

Task 4 (task4.js) - Higher Order Functions
- Functions accepting other functions as parameters
- Multiple operation examples (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Inline arrow functions and mathematical operations
- Expected Output: Calculation results using different operations

Testing Instructions

1. Test each file individually using the commands above
2. Verify console output matches expected behaviors
3. Check error handling works properly in relevant tasks
4. Confirm all calculations in task4.js produce correct results

Learning Objectives

1. Master JavaScript hoisting concepts and differences between variable types
2. Understand function declaration vs expression hoisting patterns
3. Learn 'this' keyword behavior in various contexts and function types
4. Implement higher order functions for flexible programming solutions

Key Concepts Covered

- Variable hoisting behavior (var, let, const)
- Function hoisting differences
- Lexical scope and execution context
- Arrow functions vs regular functions
- Functional programming principles
- Error handling with try-catch
